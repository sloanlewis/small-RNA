# small-RNA Expression Analysis Pipeline
Expression analysis of cellular and plasma micro RNA
The following pipeline allows you to trim small RNA reads generated from Qia-Seq protocol.
#Reads are then aligned using very sensitive settings in Bowtie2 and counted using GenomicRanges
#Differential gene expression analysis using edgeR
