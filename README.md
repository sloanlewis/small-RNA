# small-RNA Expression Analysis Pipeline
Expression analysis of cellular and plasma micro RNA
The following pipeline allows you to trim small RNA reads generated from Qia-Seq protocol.
#Reads are then aligned using very sensitive settings in Bowtie2 and counted using GenomicRanges
#Differential gene expression analysis using edgeR

## Step1: Trim files one by one using the following command: 
sbatch -p gpu --gres=gpu:1 --mem=10g --time=2:00:00 small_RNA_trimming.sh Input_Fastq_File
## Step2: Generate the targets file, data, and results directory as described in systemPipeR
## Step3: Run small_RNA_alignment.sh line by line
## Step4: Run small_RNA_readcounting.sh line by line
## Step5: Run small_RNA_edgeR.R line by line
